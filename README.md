# Chatbot
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built; Retrieval based and Generative based models.

## 1. Retrieval based Chatbots
A retrieval-based chatbot uses predefined input patterns and responses. It then uses some type of heuristic approach to select the appropriate response. It is widely used in the industry to make goal-oriented chatbots where we can customize the tone and flow of the chatbot to drive our customers with the best experience.

## 2. Generative based Chatbots
Generative models are not based on some predefined responses.

They are based on seq 2 seq neural networks. It is the same idea as machine translation. In machine translation, we translate the source code from one language to another language but here, we are going to transform input into an output. It needs a large amount of data and it is based on Deep Neural networks.

## Rule-Based approach:
Here the bot is trained based on some set rules. It is from these rules that the bot can process simple queries but can fail to process complex ones.

## About the Python Project – Chatbot
In this chatbot, we will use the rule-based approach.

## Terms to encounter
### Natural Language Processing(nltk) -
This is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages.
### Lemmatization -
This is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item and is a variation of stemming. For example “feet” and “foot” are both recognized as “foot”.
### Stemming - 
This is the process of reducing inflected words to their word stem, base, or root form. For example, if we were to stem the word “eat”, “eating”, “eats”, the result would be the single word “eat”.
### Tokenization - 
Tokens are individual words and “tokenization” is taking a text or set of text and breaking it up into its individual words or sentences.
### Bag of Words - 
This is an NLP technique of text modeling for representing text data for machine learning algorithms. It is a way of extracting features from the text for use in machine learning algorithms.
